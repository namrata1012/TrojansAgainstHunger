To maintain confidentiality, the U.S. Census Bureau suppresses data to protect the identity of any business or individual. The census results in this file contain sampling and/or nonsampling error. Data users who create their own estimates using data from this file should cite the U.S. Census Bureau as the source of the original data only. </p>

<p>To comply with disclosure avoidance guidelines, data rows with fewer than three contributing establishments are not presented.  Additionally, establishment counts are suppressed when other select statistics in the same row are suppressed.   For detailed information about the methods used to collect and produce statistics, including sampling, eligibility, questions, data collection and processing, data quality, review, weighting, estimation, coding operations, confidentiality protection, sampling error, nonsampling error, and more, see
